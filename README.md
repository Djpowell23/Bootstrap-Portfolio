Bootstrap Portfolio - Homework 2

Issues on this homework:
-Bootstrap was definitely frustrating to me. To use any kind of template for navbars or anything, I was having a really hard time making classes that would do what I want without being overwritten by the Bootstrap links.
-I am okay on the understanding of how the navbars work but I was not able to find examples of each class of the Bootstrap link and was not able to edit pieces and parts, I either had to use it all or build it from scratch. In the end I was left with a bunch of remains of all my attempts so my cleanliness definitely deteriorated towards the end.

-Again with Bootstrap, I had it all laid out on paper how I wanted it to work but something was colliding in the CSS I think that things started acting a bit odd.

-The media queries took me a little while to get down but I definitely grasped the concept for this assignment. I know it is something I will have to practice a bit more to fully get the handle on it and the structure/syntax.
